# Base Class (Mother Class or superclass):
This class allows the re-use of its `non-private` members in another class.

<br>

# Derived Class (Child Class or Subclass):
This class is the one that inherits from the superclass.

<br>

**A child class has all non-private characteristics of the mother class.**

<br>

# An object of the child class can use:
- All members defined in the child class
- All `non-private` members defined in the **mother** class.

**We can declare some classes non-inheritable using the keyword, `sealed`, like: `public sealed ClassName {..}`**
